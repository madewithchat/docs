## üîç Feature Explanation: Genius Mode

### What is Genius Mode?

**Genius Mode** is an advanced voice-activated research and ideation engine that enables our users to conduct **deep research** through **natural conversation**. It uses **multiple AI agents working in parallel** to investigate topics, validate assumptions, generate ideas, and compile actionable insights ‚Äî all in real-time and tailored to user-selected subject areas. In **Genius Mode**, users can generate comprehensive **Genius Reports** from selected content within a project.

## üß† How It Works: Functional Overview

### 1. **User Interaction Flow**

- **Step 1**: The user activates ‚ÄúGenius Mode‚Äù via voice or UI command.
- **Step 2**: The system presents customization options:
  - **Focus Mode Selector**:
    - Magic Mode (AI chooses dynamically)
    - Research (factual retrieval)
    - Validate (assumption/claim validation)
    - Ideate (creative idea generation)
  - **Subject Area Toggles (Documents)**:
    - Overview
    - Legal
    - Marketing
    - Viral Discussion
    - Reporting
- **Step 3**: User chooses genius mode (research, ideation etc.) and subjects they want to include. Additionally, user can refine output with their own prompt.
- **Step 4**: The results are aggregated and we get the Genius Report ‚Äî a large document consisting of dozens of pages which the user can refine later.

## üß© Key Functionalities

### 1. **Modes = Agents**

These are **behavioral templates** or **prompt presets** that define *how* the assistant should think:

- üßô **Magic Mode**: Creative synthesis across broad topics
- üß™ **Research Mode**: Evidence-based, analytical tone. Agent uses external web retrieval.
- üß† **Validate Mode**: Critical review, refinement, or summarization. Internal logic to assess source credibility or contradiction.
- üí° **Ideate Mode**: Brainstorming and idea generation. Prompts tuned for creativity and blue-sky thinking, possibly chain-of-thought prompting.

**‚Üí These should be implemented as agent configurations.** Each "mode" is essentially a **LangGraph node or subgraph** with a unique prompt scaffold and optional tool access.

### 2. **Subjects = Documents / Scopes**

Subjects define *what* the AI should focus on (these can be different for your project):

- Overview (high-level business model articulation)
- Legal (uses legal templates)
- Marketing (positioning, messaging, audience insights)
- Viral Discussion (social and competitor trends)
- Reporting

Each subject acts as a **data filter**‚Äîgrouping relevant content from the document tree (e.g., ‚ÄúInvestor Report‚Äù, ‚ÄúFounders election...‚Äù) before feeding it into the LangGraph context.

**‚Üí These are not agents**‚Äîthey‚Äôre input segmentation mechanisms. You can think of these as toggles controlling the subset of memory passed to the agent.

### 3. **User Prompt = Additional Modifier**

The user can add a **custom prompt** to further guide the tone, scope, or emphasis of the Genius output.

This is concatenated with the mode‚Äôs default prompt and passed to the language model during execution.
